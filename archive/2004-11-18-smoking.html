    Smoking    <small>November 18, 2004</small>
  </h1>
  </div>
    <p>I&#8217;ve taken up smoking. Why, you ask, would I do something so stupid? The short answer is: because I am a very stupid&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>Sometimes I need an edge, that&#8217;s why. Sometimes, caffeine and sugar just aren&#8217;t enough. Because sometimes lives depend on my alertness, my vigilance, my ability to&nbsp;perform.</p>
<p>Lung cancer seems like a very distant threat compared to the anti-tank mine that hit the vehicle in front of ours last night, blowing off two of its wheels and cracking its hull. It left a crater five feet deep and eight feet wide. I chain-smoked seven cigarettes, not because I was particularly rattled, but because it seemed like a thing to do. No one was hurt too badly; a broken ankle here, a sprained wrist there, a couple of brain contusions perhaps. Inexpensive Purple Hearts, compared to the guy in Red Platoon who took shrapnel from an <span class="caps">IED</span> to the face, that took his ear nearly clean off, and lodged in his sinus cavity and brain. Even he&#8217;s going to be ok,&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>I turned 23 the other day. To celebrate, I smoked a couple of cigarettes and, from atop the Haditha Dam, watched distant lightning across the reservoir, with the sound of lapping water in my&nbsp;ears.</p>
<p>I watched the stars come out for a while, savoring it because we were standing by for another&nbsp;mission.</p>
<p>I looked up at Polaris, the North Star, whose significance became clear to me on that final night of the Desert Survival Course a few months back, when, separated from the guy with the <span class="caps">GPS</span> unit, I discovered I could navigate by looking to the&nbsp;sky.</p>
<p>Since that night, I&#8217;ve been trying to learn constellations. The Big and Little Dippers are easy, and familiar from childhood. There, in the same neighborhood are what I think of as the Clash of the Titans constellations (you remember that old movie with the claymation Medusa and the clockwork owl). That misshapen &#8216;M&#8217; is the Queen, Cassiopeia, and next to her, the King, Cephus. Their daughter, Andromeda, whom they sacrificed to the sea monster, and the Hero, Perseus, flying in atop Pegasus to save&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>In some of the constellations, you can actually kind of make out what the Greeks saw. Pegasus&#8217; torso, for example, and his head and forelegs. Orion with his belt, sheathed dagger hanging, his shield ready in front of him and his spear arm reaching back, poised for the&nbsp;kill.</p>
<p>Babylon&#8217;s not far from here, it occurs to me, and these were the stars those Babylonians sought to reach with their tower. What would they think of this dam, I wonder, as overtly defiant of nature as it is? Really, the dam impresses even me. And it affords quite a view. The reservoir is big enough that at night I can pretend it&#8217;s the ocean, or I can walk to the other side and look for patrol boats on the Euphrates, stretching away ten stories&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>Being here conjures up all kinds of weird images. I see boys tending their flocks and I think of a young David, or Daoud as he&#8217;s known here, with his harp and his sling, keeping his bearings at night, perhaps, by this celestial panorama. Maybe had the the <em>Exodus</em> generation of Hebrews learned their stars better, they wouldn&#8217;t have had to wander the desert for forty years, chasing around a pillar of&nbsp;fire.</p>
<p>The water reminds me of home and sometimes I am terribly lonely and homesick. Sometimes I just hate this country, and all its stupid people. Sometimes I completely fail to connect on any level with my fellow Marines. Sometimes I am exhausted, physically and mentally, and I am conscious and ambulatory only because of all the caffeine and nicotine coursing through my&nbsp;bloodstream.</p>
<p>At times like this, my bones vibrating and my mind numb, it&#8217;s all I can do to remember why I am here. I try to imagine my friends&#8217; and family&#8217;s faces, and hope for their&nbsp;safety.</p>
<p>Sometimes I turn to the North and find Draco, the Dragon, curving out from between the two Dippers. I breathe smoke as if I, too, am a dragon, and I beg him to deliver a message to the other side of the world for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself outside on a clear, moonless night, glance Northward, look for that arching figure, and know that out of his gaping maw spew forth all my best&nbsp;wishes.</p></article>
