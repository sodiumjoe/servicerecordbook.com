    <p>These twelve to fourteen hour patrols offer plenty of time to think. Normally I spend this time in completely undirected musing, daydreams, and mind-wanderings. I have, however, made an effort of late to meditate on particular subjects, to try to explore notions less aimlessly. I fail mostly. And even when I manage to lengthen my attention span a little, the meditation tends not to be very fruitful. What few interesting notions I come up with usually are spurred by either some kind of input or sometimes just spontaneous inspiration (which is akin to divine favor). So that&nbsp;sucks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was thinking one day about my natural cynicism and my default reluctance to do anything. Because there is a strange thing I have noticed: I enjoy things a lot more than I think I will. Often I will not really feel like listening to a particular album, but I&#8217;ll put it on for lack of anything better, and end up enjoying it quite a bit. It&#8217;s the same with reading, video games, movies, bowling, eating, pretty much&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>I refer to the disparity between how much I expect to enjoy something and how much I actually end up enjoying it as my spiritual inertia, and since inertia is a property of mass, the conclusion I have come to is that: my soul is&nbsp;fat.</p>
<p>To remedy this situation, I&#8217;m putting my soul on a healthier diet, and an exercise regimen. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what these entail exactly, but here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve come up with so&nbsp;far:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more (spiritual) junk food. I suppose this means less exposure to rampant consumerism, and more resistance to my own consumerist&nbsp;impulses.</li>
<li>More veggies. I hardly ever read any kind of nonfiction that&#8217;s longer than a magazine article, and even many of those I lose interest in halfway&nbsp;through.</li>
<li>Variety. When I can get the chance I&#8217;d like to listen to more classical music, more jazz and blues. Maybe I will even give rap a chance. Not country, though. That stuff just&nbsp;sucks.</li>
<li>Exercise. I think exhaustively contemplating one subject at a time is a good start, but I also want to generally start assenting to more, to overcome my natural reluctances and just do more&nbsp;stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I suppose that&#8217;s my New Year&#8217;s resolution. But only because it happened to occur to me this time of year. I mean, it&#8217;s just as arbitrary a day to start stuff as any other day, right? And if you&#8217;re going to improve yourself, why not start&nbsp;immediately?</p>
<p>January 1 came and went mostly uneventfully over here. On New Year&#8217;s Eve, we finally got our two beers and shot of Bacardi as per the Commanding General&#8217;s Operation White Hoof, which we were first promised sometime in early November, then Thanksgiving, then Christmas. I sold mine for poker&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>The next morning, as I smoked my first cigarette of the year, I noticed a rainbow hugging close to the midmorning sun and I tried to imagine an impossibly high wall of water tearing across the Earth, destroying indiscriminately, killing thousands upon thousands, extinguishing all those tiny lives like candles. I wondered if the tsunami could be seen from space, and I wondered how many of those people went to Hell. I tried to distinguish as many individual colors as I could and it occurred to me how empty God&#8217;s promise to Noah really was. If you think about it, an omnipotent being promising not to destroy the world in one particular way is akin to a man with an arsenal at his disposal promising not to kill you with one particular weapon: meaningless and&nbsp;absurd.</p>
<p>Every time I hear mention of this event I am filled with fresh amazement, disbelief, and horror. Catastrophe on this scale really serves to put stuff into&nbsp;perspective.</p>
<p>I (again) got caught making poopy when we took incoming a couple of days ago and I could actually hear the mortar round whistling as it hurtled toward me, but I couldn&#8217;t manage to work up any strong feelings about it. I considered the physics of a mortar round for a while, imagined the simple and clean parabola, full with latent violence, connecting us with the enemy in a fourth dimensional kind of way. In the context of a world that will wreak so much death on a whim, us trying to kill each other a handful at a time just seems silly, like children bickering over some&nbsp;trinket.</p>
<p>I wiped my ass as if in a dream, went inside for cover and dozed off to Eels&#8217; <em>Daisies of the Galaxy</em>, punctuated by the bass drum thumping of our return fire, thinking about our mortarmen retracing the insurgents&#8217; parabolas with outgoing, and dreamed an insane dream about cutting my chest open to look at my&nbsp;heart.</p></article>
