    <p>Our company&#8217;s callsigns are organized thus: 1st platoon is Red, 2nd platoon is White, and 3rd platoon is Blue. <span class="caps">HQ</span> is Black, Mortars Brown, and TOWs are Green. Each vehicle within each platoon also has a numerical designator: Red 1, Red 2, Red 3, Red 4, White 1, White 2, etc. Our new bastard platoon consists of old Red 4, White 4 (me), and Blue 4. Officially we&#8217;re Gray platoon, our vehicle being Gray 1, but we&#8217;ve been called everything from Pink to Purple to&nbsp;Rainbow.</p>
<p>Also, because of the lack of enough officers to go around, our platoon commander is a staff sergeant, making our platoon comprised entirely of enlisted men. Which we&nbsp;prefer.</p>
<p>Anyway, yesterday, our second day out in our Area of Operation, a bunch of the leadership were out with a <span class="caps">1LAR</span> guide element doing a leaders&#8217; recon, while the rest of us stayed in a defensive coil somewheres. Less than an hour after they left, the vehicle our platoon sergeant was riding on hit a double stack of landmines and the vehicle our platoon commander was on was hit by an&nbsp;<span class="caps">IED</span>.</p>
<p>Our first full day out in the field and we&#8217;d already lost our new platoon&#8217;s entire chain of&nbsp;command.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re actually ok, though. Sgt. T_____ has two ruptured eardrums and a contusion on his posterior, and Ssgt. B____ got hit on the helmet with shrapnel or a rock or something and has moderate&nbsp;whiplash.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty rude&nbsp;welcome.</p>
<p>So now we&#8217;re in the rear, back at the firm base, until our chain of command recovers, which shouldn&#8217;t be more than a few&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>It all still has yet to really sink in, and I doubt IEDs will really feel like a real threat until I see one firsthand, and maybe not even&nbsp;then.</p>
<p>I see a lot of the guys I went to School of Infantry with here in <span class="caps">1LAR</span>. It&#8217;s strange seeing my peers here as basically the main workhorses of the unit. But then I look around and realize that it&#8217;s the same in my own unit. We&#8217;re not the ignorant inexperienced boots anymore, bumbling around trying not to get into trouble. We are now the main body, keeping things running, teaching the newer Marines, setting examples. I don&#8217;t remember that happening. But suddenly, here I am, about to hit my two-year mark. They say it&#8217;s all downhill from here, but I imagine this deployment will provide some uphill&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>The joy in the Marines of <span class="caps">1LAR</span> is palpable, but it&#8217;s mixed with a slight apprehensiveness, I think. No one wants to be the one to get killed just days before getting to go&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been issued these awful, ridiculous shoulder-pad attachments to our flak jackets. These things just keep getting more and more cumbersome. Just to make things that much more ridiculous for us, it&#8217;s impossible to get them on properly by one&#8217;s self, so now we actually have to help each other don armor. It&#8217;s pretty&nbsp;nuts.</p>
<p>I downloaded my first &#8216;roll&#8217; of pictures onto my ipod today. 227 pictures fit on the 256 <span class="caps">MB</span> <span class="caps">CF</span> card. I&#8217;m wondering how long all my electronics will last in this invasive dust, though. My iPod&#8217;s already acting just a little funny, and I can feel grit in the moving parts of my&nbsp;camera.</p>
<p>I apologize if these posts are kinda retarded. I&#8217;ve been writing stuff down in my notebook whenever I can, and I haven&#8217;t had time to consolidate the stuff into coherent, uh, compositions or something. Plus, we only get 20 minutes at a time on these crappy laptops, and we have to wait in line for at least like an hour to get on for each 20 minutes. I hate laptop&nbsp;keyboards.</p></article>
