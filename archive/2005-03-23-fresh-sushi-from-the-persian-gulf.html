    Fresh Sushi from the Persian Gulf    <small>March 23, 2005</small>
  </h1>
  </div>
    <p>Some background: Corporal K____, sometimes known as Caveman K____, is a big burly blonde dude from Minnesota, real into hunting and fishing. Especially fishing. He&#8217;s the kind of guy whose jovial slap on the back will knock the wind out of you, who&#8217;s constantly gut-checking you out of genuine affection. He also likes jumping, up and down, from perch to perch, off of things, just jumping in&nbsp;general.</p>
<p>At the Haditha Dam, in our off time, while I was reading or whatever, and the rest of the Marines were working out or whatever, K____ took the tiny fishing kit he brought with him, not much more than a length of fishing line and a small hook, and some meat from the chow hall and caught a few carp out of the reservoir. If we&#8217;d had time and permission, I&#8217;m sure he would have built a fire and cooked it,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>K____ and W_______ have been going fishing off the little pier that stretches out off the beach a little ways whenever they find time and had caught quite a bit: some cod-looking things, some flying fish, and yesterday, a&nbsp;cuttlefish.</p>
<p>They had pictures of it and were showing me, and when I told them it looked tasty, they bet me I wouldn&#8217;t eat&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Fuck you, I&#8217;ll eat that shit raw,&#8221; I told&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>So I stopped by the pier today and sure enough, K____ had managed to catch another cuttlefish, a weird striped one that had inked all over them and everything. As they watched in giddy excitement, I cut off one of the tentacles, washed it off with a bottle of water, bit off the little suction-cuppy end, chewed and&nbsp;swallowed.</p>
<p>It could&#8217;ve used a little cocktail sauce or something, but it was alright. Though they were kinda freaked out and scared, I eventually coaxed each of them to try it (by questioning his courage or calling him a &#8216;pussy&#8217;, you can pretty much get a Marine to do anything), and they agreed it wasn&#8217;t&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>I have a fond memory of when I was a young boy, in Korea, walking down the beach with my uncle. There was a little stand there, where these little octopi that were caught right off the beach were cleaned and gutted right in front of you and served chopped up, but still wriggling. I remember a sense of wonder and awe, not fear or&nbsp;disgust.</p>
<p>I guess I never did learn to be afraid or disgusted by little things like that, like so many people do, but I wish I could call back that sense of wonder, and hold it like I hold that memory, to recognize all the wondrous things that must happen all around me every&nbsp;day.</p></article>
